# Sample Node.js Application

This document provides an overview of a sample Node.js application, including its architecture and workflow, illustrated with Mermaid diagrams.

---

## Application Overview

The sample Node.js application is a RESTful API that performs CRUD operations on a database. It is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data.

## Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the application:

```mermaid

    API -->|CRUD Operations| DB[MongoDB Database]
    API --> Logger[Logging Service]
    Logger --> FileSystem[Log Files]
```

## Workflow Diagram

The workflow for handling a typical API request is shown below:

    API-->>Client: Send HTTP Response
```

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sample-nodejs-app.git
   cd sample-nodejs-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.
